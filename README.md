About me
 
    My name is Laramie Dunlap, I'm a derivatives trader and sports enthusiast 

    My career goals are to develop machine learning solutions to help solve optimal real-time risk problems faced by traders or bettors

    I chose FinTech as a career path because the field contains the tools to help solve probabilistic problems that arise every day in the markets
